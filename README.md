Basically tried to find the best code that I could for each gamemode and put them here. All of this was made by rxzyx (https://github.com/rxzyx/Blooket-Hacks) and gliz (https://github.com/therealgliz/blooket-hacks)
Also, nothing here doesn't work.
If anything doesn't work, submit an issue.
Thanks!
If you want to copy faster, for the 1 line code you can click the one, click the three dots and then click copy line.
