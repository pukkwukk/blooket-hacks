How do you use these hacks? copy all of the code for the hack you want to use. if you are in that gamemode click ctrl+shift+i and it will open up inspect element. Click console and then paste in the code.

Basically tried to find the best code that I could for each gamemode and put them here. All of this was made by rxzyx (https://github.com/rxzyx/Blooket-Hacks) and gliz (https://github.com/therealgliz/blooket-hacks)
Also, nothing here doesn't work.
If anything doesn't work, submit an issue.
Thanks!
If you want to copy faster, for the 1 line code you can click the one, click the three dots and then click copy line.
